Single Cell Resolution Analysis for Bioinformatic Sequencing: Develop a deep learning generative model for single cell sequencing data. The revolution of single cell high throughput technology has generated a massive amount of genomic data for understanding molecular mechanisms at single cell resolution. However, the bioinformatics tools for single cell sequencing data analysis are under-developed, and the traditional machine learning methods for bulk sequencing data donâ€™t work well for single cell data. Help develop a software package that integrates advanced statistical method and deep learning modeling.
